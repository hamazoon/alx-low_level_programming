# 0x0A. Argc, Argv

This directory contains solutions to problems related to command-line arguments in C programming. `argc` (argument count) and `argv` (argument vector) are used in C to handle command-line input. These problems help to understand how command-line arguments are passed to programs and how to process them.

## Directory Contents

- `0-whatsmyname.c`: A program that prints its name, followed by a new line.
- `1-args.c`: A program that prints the number of arguments passed to it.
- `2-args.c`: A program that prints all arguments it receives.
- `3-mul.c`: A program that multiplies two numbers passed as arguments.
- `4-add.c`: A program that adds a list of numbers passed as arguments.
- `100-change.c`: A program that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for a given amount of money.

## Purpose

This directory focuses on handling command-line arguments in C. It provides various examples of how to access and manipulate arguments passed to a program. Through these exercises, you will gain a better understanding of how `argc` and `argv` work and how they can be used for practical purposes in your programs.

## Compilation

To compile the programs, use the following command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o program
