# 0x06. More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

This directory builds upon the foundational concepts of pointers, arrays, and strings, diving deeper into their applications and functionality in C programming. These exercises are part of the ALX Software Engineering Program.

## Project Objectives

- Explore advanced pointer manipulation techniques.
- Work with multidimensional arrays.
- Implement and manipulate strings efficiently.
- Solve complex problems using pointers and arrays.

|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0-strcat.c`           | A function that concatenates two strings.                                  |
| `1-strncat.c`          | A function that concatenates two strings with a limit on the number of bytes. |
| `2-strncpy.c`          | A function that copies a string up to a specified number of bytes.          |
| `3-strcmp.c`           | A function that compares two strings.                                      |
| `4-rev_array.c`        | A function that reverses the content of an array of integers.               |
| `5-string_toupper.c`   | A function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.     |
| `6-cap_string.c`       | A function that capitalizes all words of a string.                         |
| `7-leet.c`             | A function that encodes a string into `1337` speak.                        |
| `100-rot13.c`          | A function that encodes a string using `rot13`.                            |
| `101-print_number.c`   | A function that prints an integer without using `long`, arrays, or pointers. |
| `102-magic.c`          | A program demonstrating a specific pointer manipulation trick.             |
| `103-infinite_add.c`   | A function that adds two numbers stored as strings.                        |
| `104-print_buffer.c`   | A function that prints a buffer, showing content in both hexadecimal and ASCII. |
