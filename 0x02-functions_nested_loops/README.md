# 0x02. Functions, Nested Loops

This directory contains projects and tasks that focus on understanding and implementing functions and nested loops in C. These exercises are part of the ALX Software Engineering Program and emphasize modular programming, recursion, and advanced looping techniques.

## Project Objectives

- Learn how to write and use functions in C.
- Understand the importance of function prototypes and declarations.
- Work with nested loops to perform complex iterative tasks.
- Explore the scope of variables and how they affect program behavior.
