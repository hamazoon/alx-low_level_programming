# 0x04. More Functions, More Nested Loops

This directory contains projects and tasks that focus on advanced usage of functions and nested loops in C programming. These exercises are part of the ALX Software Engineering Program and emphasize reusability, modularity, and problem-solving through structured code.

## Project Objectives

- Deepen understanding of functions and nested loops.
- Explore advanced techniques for managing program flow.
- Solve problems that require efficient looping and function usage.
- Strengthen debugging and testing skills for functions and loops.
