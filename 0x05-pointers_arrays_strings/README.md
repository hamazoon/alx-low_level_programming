# 0x05. Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

This directory contains projects and tasks that focus on the usage of pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming. These exercises are part of the ALX Software Engineering Program and aim to deepen the understanding of memory management and data manipulation.

## Project Objectives

- Understand and use pointers to access and manipulate memory.
- Work with arrays for data storage and retrieval.
- Explore string manipulation techniques in C.
- Solve problems requiring dynamic memory management and pointer arithmetic.

| `5-rev_string.c`       | A function that reverses a string.                                         |
| `6-puts2.c`            | A function that prints every other character of a string.                  |
| `7-puts_half.c`        | A function that prints the second half of a string.                        |
| `8-print_array.c`      | A function that prints `n` elements of an array of integers.               |
| `9-strcpy.c`           | A function that copies a string to a buffer.                               |
| `100-atoi.c`           | A function that converts a string to an integer.                           |
| `101-keygen.c`         | A program that generates random valid passwords for a program.             |
