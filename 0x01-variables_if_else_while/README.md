# 0x01. Variables, If, Else, While

This directory contains projects and tasks for learning how to use variables, conditional statements, and loops in C. These exercises are part of the ALX Software Engineering Program and focus on control flow and basic C programming constructs.

## Project Objectives

- Understand and use variables of different types.
- Learn conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`).
- Implement and utilize loops (`while`, `for`).
- Work with relational and logical operators.
- Develop a deeper understanding of control flow in C programs.

| `4-print_alphabt.c`    | A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, excluding `q` and `e`.   |
| `5-print_numbers.c`    | A C program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0. |
| `6-print_numberz.c`    | A C program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 using only `putchar`. |
| `7-print_tebahpla.c`   | A C program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse using `putchar`.  |
| `8-print_base16.c`     | A C program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase using `putchar`. |
| `9-print_comb.c`       | A C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.  |
