# Low Level Programming & Algorithms

Welcome to my low level C programming experience at ALX Africa. Here I will be documenting what I have learned through a series of projects


## Table of Contents

- [Getting Started](#getting-started)
- [Goals](#goals)
- [Projects](#projects)

## Getting Started

If you're new to C programming, here are some resources to get you started:

- [C Programming on geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-programming-language/)
- [C Programming javatpoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/c-programming-language-tutorial)

Feel free to explore the code examples and projects in this repository to practice and enhance your skills.

## Goals

- Learn about low level C code by building many functions from the ground up
- Will not use stdlib in the first few sets of problems
- Learn about low level C code by building many functions from the ground up
- Build our own printf statement, possibly in a seperate project

## Projects

This repository includes various C programming projects and code examples. You can find detailed information about each project in their respective directories. Here are some of the featured projects:
