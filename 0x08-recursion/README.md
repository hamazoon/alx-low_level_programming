# 0x08. Recursion

This directory contains solutions to problems related to recursion in C programming. Recursion is a powerful programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve smaller instances of the same problem. The problems in this directory help demonstrate the basics of recursion and its applications.

## Directory Contents

- `0-puts_recursion.c`: A program that prints a string using recursion.
- `1-print_rev_recursion.c`: A program that prints a string in reverse using recursion.
- `2-strlen_recursion.c`: A function that returns the length of a string using recursion.
- `3-factorial.c`: A function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.
- `4-pow_recursion.c`: A function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y` using recursion.
- `5-sqrt_recursion.c`: A function that returns the natural square root of a number using recursion.
- `6-is_prime_number.c`: A function that checks if a number is prime using recursion.
- `7-is_palindrome.c`: A function that checks if a string is a palindrome using recursion.
- `8-wildcmp.c`: A function that compares two strings, allowing wildcard characters (`*`), using recursion.

## Purpose

This directory helps in understanding how recursion works in C. The problems and solutions provide various examples of how recursion can be applied to different types of problems, from string manipulation to mathematical computations.

## Compilation

To compile the programs, use the following command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o recursion
