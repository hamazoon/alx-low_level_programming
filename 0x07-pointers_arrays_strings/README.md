# 0x07. Even More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

This directory delves further into pointers, arrays, and strings, focusing on advanced operations and memory manipulation in C programming. These exercises are part of the ALX Software Engineering Program.

## Project Objectives

- Understand and implement multidimensional arrays.
- Work with memory allocation and manipulation functions.
- Deepen understanding of pointers to pointers and their applications.
- Solve problems using efficient algorithms with pointers and arrays.

| `3-strspn.c`           | A function that gets the length of a prefix substring.                    |
| `4-strpbrk.c`          | A function that searches a string for any set of bytes.                   |
| `5-strstr.c`           | A function that locates a substring.                                      |
| `7-print_chessboard.c` | A function that prints a chessboard.                                       |
| `8-print_diagsums.c`   | A function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix.    |
| `100-set_string.c`     | A function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.                    |
| `101-crackme_password` | A file containing the password for a given program.                       |
